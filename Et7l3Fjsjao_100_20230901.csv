It also should be noted that no armour has ever been mass produced. They all required fitting, and for that reason a 'quartermaster' is one of the oldest military postings.
So yeah, you would definitely notice a woman in full plate armour. It'd be hard to miss. - The breastplate would protrude and the gorget have an extra layer.

The tradition of booby armours actually began long ago as well. Thespians & dancers (obviously), but also the final pieces of famous gladiators, and of course *ceremonially*. They were often quite decorative. - Similarly, most full plate belonging to women of history, were also cerremonial, may even have only been decorative.

Greetings to your Lordship! 

I don't know if this is still an active site or not, so I'll ask my question, if it's been covered, I apologize. 

I just discovered this site today, and I'm intrigued to say the least. So I sincerely hope it's an active site.

In the Judeo Christian tradition, we are told that people lived an incredible, ridiculously long time. 

Hundreds and hundreds of years. I know that some other cultures have similar accounts of longevity. 

My question: Is there any credible evidence that people actually did live hundreds, or thousands of years in ancient times? 

Or did they calculate years differently back then? 

Okay, that's actually two questions.  I appreciate your time your Lordship.",UCOqgFZAAD7mZ0wyHE1nRoyg

43,Ugw9M8IzFm9ygECNS0Z4AaABAg,Samaritan,"The whole debate has a flawed premise. Almost universally, women DIDN’T fight on the battlefield, in nearly any culture across history until the last century. Those minute few who did simply had to make do with the best male hand-me-down equipment available. Unicorn cases like Joan of Arc only serve as exceptions which prove the rule… as she did not ever actually fight, but was a commander only. Melee combat requires strength and stamina that women—who are routinely outdone by scarcely-pubescent boys in these fields—simply cannot achieve. 

No peoples would risk their birth rates, casualty rates and morale by allowing women to fight their wars except in very rare extenuating circumstances. That, or very backwards cultures. Women were trained to fight routinely in many cultures, that’s true—as a last resort, or to guard the homestead. Again, barring unicorn cases, that was it.

Having spent 30 years in the military and Law Enforcement, I can say from experience that females do not possess the native strength to carry the weight of even modern body armor and gear.  Even if the rare female who could physically carry the weight, she would be ineffective in battle because she couldn't move.  She would fatigue over time and distance.  Steel armor is much heavier and not possible.  Cops typically carry 20-25 lbs on their bodies consisting of body armor, belt, gun and gear.

I agree with 99% of what you have said here but you are assuming that ""sexy"" isn't subjective. Look at the ancient Indian statues of their different goddesses. The depictions they made of their fertility gods were always nude, and well endowed. 

What is my point,  even then when men depicted something that was ""sexy"" it almost always did not include armor. Because armor isn't sexy, and being a ""warrior"" is a personality attribute that while being desirable is also not ""sexy"". If you look at the general consensus men have always desired more flesh, and less clothing on their perspective sexual partners.

IRL, in the late Middle Age you had those bulging codpieces in plate armor (that copied the codpieces worn in civil clothing), that weren't designed with a purely functional aim, but more as a fashion.

In a fantasy world were women warriors are more common, couldn't plate armor designed for them have the profile of breasts on the breastplate, as a fashion thing to exalt their femininity?

Why do you have long hair?

 Although some Roman men had beards, I know of no Roman men who had long hair, and definitely not any Roman soldiers. 

Since you do re-enactments and dress as a Roman soldier, I expect to see a Roman haircut and a Roman shave. Romans even ""shaved"" their skin, didn't they (at the baths)?

Of course you are free to live your life any way you want. Since you dress like a Roman and do re-enactments though, I feel you should look the part and as far as I know, no good Roman soldier would ever have had long hair (after all, it can be a liability in battle too).

Modern soldiers also have short hair, it's more practical and safer, health wise too. If you really love long hair, and can't live without it, perhaps a hair net will help?",UCKX-Q2TKOX5HrnRxks-TidQ

While women on average are smaller than men, there are plenty of tall heavily muscled (and heavy) women. Such women would be more likely to have the physical abilities that make a good warrior. In armor, they would be indistinguishable from men, and larger than quite a few small men.

For a modern example, look at women's ice hockey players. In uniform, with all the padding, they look very much like male players. Undressed, they're still taller and more muscled than average women. Short slim athletes go out for gymnastics, not hockey.

In the same way, women with warrior bodies will wear armor and fight. Women without the strength and fighting ability who are in the military would be cooks, or any of a dozen support positions.",UCh7-9SpE299NHqmM9sxqmfA

So not ""breast shaped"" but the bulge would not sit as low as in the male version depending on the wearers chest size.
Full blown turnier armor had even very pronounced chest bulge and fixed plate to protect the gorget armor. ({do not know the english terms for armor parts very well sorry)

ARMOR OF GOD      
This prayer is based on Ephesians 6:10-18 - posting it here for those who want to copy it.
""Heavenly Father,
Your warrior prepares for battle,
Today, I claim victory over the enemy satan by putting on the whole Armor of God.
I put on the GIRDLE OF TRUTH
May I stand firm in the truth of Your Word so I will not be a victim of the enemy's lies.
I put on the BREASTPLATE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS
May it guard my heart from evil so I will remain pure and Holy, protected under the blood of Jesus Christ.
I put on the SHOES OF PEACE
May I stand firm in the Good News of the Gospel so your peace will shine through me and be a light to all I encounter.
I take the SHIELD OF FAITH
May I be ready for the enemy's fiery darts of doubt, denial and deceit so I will not be vulnerable to spiritual defeat.
I put on the HELMET OF SALVATION
May I keep my mind focused on You so the enemy will not have a stronghold on my thoughts.
I take the SWORD OF THE SPIRIT
May the two-edged sword of Your Word be ready in my hands so I can expose the tempting words of the enemy.
I take the heavy artillery WEAPON OF PRAYER
May I keep praying without ceasing, so that I am not deceived.
By faith Your warrior has put on the whole Armor of God and am prepared to live this day in spiritual victory.

If it for more of a prestige thing like some more casual stuff or ceremonie I could see them have some curve into the plate for #1 looking more like a female since alot of ceremonial stuff and casual prestige would care more about aparence and less about effectiveness.
And finally it is showed that dick armor was a thing and boobs armor would probably be #1 easyer to make and more classy than Dick armor let be real... Also it showen that some female armor keep the form of the body exemple fencing armor keep the boobs armor since blunt impact isn't much of a prob and it try to protect form peircing / slashing more than Blunt.


Any way It not a big deal as long as they don't show up all there skin for no reason Plate would protect form slaching any way so really just put them 90% in Plate and protect there vital organe and stuff and you would have a fine armor design in my opinion. (Kof Kof Camilla fate isn't a great exemple of that... What the fux is that cleavage Ok yah I could see it being fine if she was in light armor and was supose to not be in the front line but still...)

But i am curious about something else.  You say that you are Italian, and i have no reason to doubt your claim, but you say you are not Italian in your accent when you speak English. And granted, your English is excellent, but i am also not a linguist that might pick it to pieces  -Oh the memories of grammar school and all those scientific lessons about English!  OMFW!  If you know how to speak, you speak!  If you know how to write, you write!  There are plenty of great communicators who only had that much grasp on the English language, but made that limited understanding count!  :) 


How does that happen, losing your Italian accent?  Here in the states i was often told  that television gradually normalized peoples accents.  I am not convinced of that really.  I have lived deep in Appalachia for example, where people take great pride in their ""otherness"".  But even there, some people have accent, and some don't.  At the same time, that southern drawl is an easy thing to pick up on subconsciously -but it is terrible if you try to fake it.  For the love of God, when you are speaking American English, and i am not saying that you ever have, but do not ever try to fake the southern accents of American English!  :)  That accent has to come as natural as breathing, or it just doesn't work.  I was never able to get it for myself, as much as i loved the South.

For example, Kassandra can wear ""Agamaenon's armor"" and still be confused as a boy (since it looks smaller in height, she is of thinner body building for such a heavy armor but still has a bearded mask).",UCHA49vMFFVhsEyDYFRregPw

Ultimately, the people who poke their eyes out with toothpicks or get offended by the mention of a women's breast aren't worth consideration. Why feed into a society's frailties?

1208,Ugxqqv30nbuBKp53dqB4AaABAg,Grahame Nicholson,Jeanne D'Arc might have been given some armor but did not fight or command an army. This is  fiction. She was a religious and political figure. She claimed to have visions from angels and saints claiming Gods support for French victory. This was reported to King Charles. He sent her to Orleans which was under siege and the siege was lifted 9 days later thus she became  a religious icon  who inspired the French army to believe God was on their side.  She accompanied the army in several other successful battles. Maybe she was given some armor maybe she was not but was later depicted in armor by artists. She certainly did not need it. She was not in command and did not fight in the battles. The Burgundian's captured her and handed her over to the English who handed her to the Bishop of Beauvais Pierre Cauchon who found her guilty of a variety of religious charges concerned with lying about falsely claiming a divine mission from the Angel  Michael. Cauchon found her guilty and turned her over to civil authorities to be burned for heresy. The pope overturned this decision after her death and made her a saint.  NOT A FEMALE WARRIOR.

As to women warriors ... 

The thing is while culture plays a part in it - it's really all about money.  Warriors are expensive.  Whether it's guns or swords their equipment isn't cheap.  More importantly though - is their time.  If they're going to be any good - they have to train and while they are training - they are NOT doing something more economically productive ... like growing food.

Now - there have been studies done buy such as the American Army on training females in combat roles.  And they figured out how to do it.  The biggest problem was that the AVERAGE female simply isn't as strong as the AVERAGE male.  But - with an extra 3 months of training - they can bulk those girls up until they can meet the same physical fitness standards as the average male.  But - here is where money raises it's ugly head again.  Training time is expensive - as they aren't doing anything then - they're just training - so taking an extra 3 months or so to train the girls to be as strong as the guys ... costs a lot of money.  If they have 12 weeks of training for the boys - and 15 weeks of training for the girls - it's just more expensive to train the girls to do combat roles than it is the guys.

So - what they have done is to not even try to randomly assign girls to combat roles the way they do with guys - they have the girls volunteer for it - which means the girls are doing all that extra training - on their own - and it's not costing the Army anything.  The problem with that - is that you just don't have that many girls who will make the effort to bring themselves up to the male PT standards.

Here you run into money again.  Our culture is not like that of the movie Starship Troopers where all the people in a unit sleep in the same squad bay and take showers together.  No.  We don't do that.  So - if you are going to have to have women present in a unit - you have to have changes in the accommodations because of that.  Any time you have to do something because everything is not the same (like using two different types of bullets) it costs money.  There is an extra effort that has to be made and that extra effort comes out of someplace.  The military never has enough time and never has enough money to do all the things they could be doing to make themselves better - so that fewer of them will die.  So - anything that takes away from that - may ultimately be paid for in blood.

Then of course you have all those problems that crop up because of having people working together who want to have sex with each other.  Sexual harassment - rape - favoritism, fraternization ... it never never ends. But at least you can put the women in one barracks and the men in another so that the women don't have to take showers with people who want to have sex with them.  Which you can't do with homosexuals ... but that's another topic ...  All these extra 'things' detract from the one thing the military wants to do which is be prepared to fight a war so that they will be more effective and fewer of them will die.  For all the people running the military - that - is the thing that is in the back of their skulls all the time.  Nations which are not prepared for war - suffer horribly when it comes - as the USA did at the start of WWII.

One thing a lot of people don't think about is the fact that all the women in the military being in their prime child bearing years - at any one point in time - 25% of them are pregnant.  They used to put them out of the military when that happened but they simply can't do that any more - they need them to badly - so they keep them but then they have to find a job for them that a pregnant lady at whatever stage of her pregnancy she is in - can do.  Then of course, once the baby comes - you have this woman who has an infant to take care of so most of them are out on some kind of maternity leave.  Then of course you have a woman with children - who is going to get deployed and not be able to take those children with her.  If her husband happens to be deployed at the same time (assuming she has a husband and isn't a single parent) then who is going to take care of those children?  Hopefully they have family ...  I don't know what they do if they don't. 

So - why do we have women in the military at all?  Because they don't have enough men.  Without the draft - they just can't get enough men to serve so they have to fill out their ranks with women.  And - the women do a good job.  They are dedicated, they are brave and having them doubles the pool of people available and lets the military choose people with more intelligence instead of just taking whatever they can get.

So - you can train women to be soldiers - it's just that there are problems you have to deal with when you do that.  In the days of old - they had enough men to chose from and the women were performing important economic tasks, such as caring for the children, crafting, growing food, etc.  so they didn't use them for soldiers.

Some cultures, mostly those where predators, human and animal alike, were a problem - they did train their women to some degree to defend themselves but that's only going to do so much.  Mostly - as with the Native Americans in North America - they trained the women to scoop up the kids - and run.  The Indian tribes attacked each other all the time and other than another tribe they might be allied with - hated each others guts.  You can't be a warrior if you don't have someone to fight - so they raided each other all the time for horses, other stuff and women and children.  Children they could raise as their own (so those stories about a child being made a member of the tribe are true) whereas they could have the women's wombs making babies for their tribe instead of their enemies tribe.  

Their problem with that - was that when the European Settlers showed up - they treated them the same way - and the settlers had more numbers and a vastly larger army to support them (eventually).  To give you an idea of the magnitude of the problem they faced - at the Little Big Horn the Indians had about a 1000 warriors and Custer had about 435 guys.  At Gettysburg - there were over 70,000 guys - ON EACH SIDE.  The Red Men killed twice as many Whites as they lost in the American Indian Wars (mostly settlers) but it didn't matter.

1220,Ugxo9z_8R7T71EC5w_d4AaABAg,Bob Smith,"Nice video.   I liked it.

Now, that said, pretty much all the armor in computer games is fantasy armor.  If you look at the really, really good armor - the thing that differentiates it from the regular old ordinary armor - is that it's fancier.  Now - in the real world - that kind of armor would only be worn for ceremonial purposes.  When they went into combat - they used plainer stuff (without as many curly ques to catch points on) that was actually stronger than the fancy stuff. 

BUT in video games - they make the really, really good armor all fancy because the people who play those games like looking fancy. And - it can be THOUSANDS of times more effective than regular armor.  Look at a high level player and they might have 300,000 hit points where a newb has like 300 ...  There is no armor THAT good.  So - ALL the armor in these games is Fantasy Armor.  The female armor is just sexier because that's what people - who by the way are mostly guys - want their chick characters to look like.  

For those who don't play fantasy games - all those guys controlling chick characters are NOT pretending to be girls (they all know that since 90% of the people playing those games are male - almost all the chick characters are controlled by guys) - they are using chick characters because when they are running their character around in 3rd person - they would much rather look at a girls ass than a guys.  It is that simple.

The odd thing here - is that a lot of the players who ARE girls - often play male characters so they won't get hit on.

So - with most of the players controlling female characters being guys - of course they put them in skimpy outfits.  As far as the game is concerned - they have just as many hit points as the male armor does.  So - from a gaming point of view - what difference does it make?

Another thing you will see in some games - is the option for the characters helmet to NOT be displayed. It is there - they are getting the hit points for having it - but if you have it set to turn off it's display - it isn't shown so you can see the characters face and hair.

In some Asian games - the female characters default costume is a frilly dress with petticoats. It has hit points just like armor but it doesn't look like armor any more than a bikini would.  My guess is that the reason for that is the influence Anime has had on the designers.  In Anime it is not uncommon for the female characters to be leaping about in frilly dresses while shooting fire balls out of the palms of their hands.  But - like I said - that's just a guess, I really don't know.

You could criticize the appearance of dragons in contemporary fiction in similar manner, knowing that they are mythical, fantasy creatures. Meanwhile we have an established visual image of a female warrior dating back to earliest examples of fantasy fiction in 20th century, even if it is considered controversial and sexist by some, it is still a part of our cultural history and you should respect that.

Let me give you a somewhat similar example: did you know that christian institutions were condemning and attacking Dungeons and Dragons and similar tabletop games for depiction of magic and violence (and sexual imagery, for that matter, just like feminists) in the 80s because they considered that media a satanist propaganda and generally a bad influence that spoils children?

However, despite what feminists will say you'll find that there were women with power and influence even then and such women were expected to turn out with their armies if only just for show (that applies mainly to men leaders as well) and would have had armour for that purpose.
   Travel as well could be a dangerous affair and if you had to travel in an area where rebels and the like were active then a wealthy woman may want to have some armour... The other thing that is easy to forget is that people are prone to look at the past and assume that attitudes adapted in the Victorian era were prevalent in earlier times; when a city was under seige for instance the enemy did not let the women and children out to have dinner, if the defences did get breached the attackers would be thinking usually of two things..1:loot and 2:rape!

I´m really surprised about how many MRA-like, subhuman, subsapiens scum are spread out there saying bullshit. Soo many ""people"" to be gunned, so sad. Women didn´t usually go to war because socioeconomic reasons, not ""biological"" ones. Patriarchal societies (and not ""THE patriarchy, just actual Patriarchal societies) were demographically more dinamic (not stronger, not better at war, just demographically more dinamic) and came to dominate most territories. Last non-patriarchal societies ceased to exist or turned into patriarchal ones about 400-600BC (much before Vikings). Thats historical facts. The rest is underdicked crybaby rants. 

I´m not discussing with anybody anyways, because all the rubbish pointed here comes from pseudo-scientific, idiotic red-piller trash whose most praised ""scientist"" is that underbrained pseudobiologist Dawkins. The day this shit reach an actual academy in some remote form i would consider to spoke with it.  Meanwhile, i fear that i would lose cognitive capacities just trying to figure what kind of pre-logic structures were employed to construct those ""arguments"". 

Now about this subject: My first impression when i watch those widespread types of ""female armor"" is that they come from people that actually doesnt have the slightest idea of how a breast behaves in terms of physics. There is nothing, nothing in female anatomy that would ""obstruct"" or be ""unconfortable"" for the use of the same armor designs that were used for men.

But put fantasy armor like that in next to Conan the Barbarian running around in the leather underwear and it's ""I can see it"" because everyone has decided to throw logic to the wind and the person the camera can see best (thus, armored people's faces are covered making them mooks) is gonna be the winner. Conan would look just as ridiculous next to Joan of Arc in her full plate. Of course the reason it comes up on female armor is as you put, a vast majority of movies/games/images/costumes put the gal in the ridiculous over the top armor and unless the male is a barbarian, or a poorly done viking, they're almost always in armor.

1352,UgwRaPtPs0w3YEuyR_x4AaABAg,Gräs peau,"For every people who believe ""women armour"" to be fantasy ""cauz women fighting on the battlefield makes no god damn sense!"" ; women actually had the capacity to fight and sometime a place on the battlefields. 
The fact that women are, on average, weaker that men doesn't mean all women are weaker than all men, which means if you'd have to pick only the strongest individuals of a group you might end up with a few women in there.
Also do keep in mind that strength isn't that much of a huge advantage, that is as long as you have enough to properly wield your weapon -which can be easily obtained through training-. What matter the most after that are speed, precision and technique ; things that are hardly gender dependant.
The fact that women never fought on the battlefield is also a misconception, there are a few notable examples of women fighters in history such as shieldmaidens or onna-bugeisha (or even members of the ""Order of the Hatchet"", but these were not really trained warriors...), and the relative rarity of women fighters in history can easily be explained by cultural reasons (as in about every society I know of, women  were, both in time and peace and in time of war, given a specific role (tending to the house, taking care of the children(...)) and that this role was imposed to them by the often very rigid societies that were prominent through history. The fact that in cultures this role has mainly been given to women is probably explainable either by the fact that many of these cultures had a common ""cultural ancestor"" with the same place in society given to women or by the fact that these are amongst the only activities a pregnant person could decently do(and considering the average household size (around 6 I believe in western Europe) and amazingly high child mortality,  o boy did they had to be pregnant often.)",UCfwdKSQ5X4yzcOAPDAvGHyg

Ultra warrior societies like the Genghis Khan era Mongols and the ancient Spartans would have had armoured women as every true citizen of a warrior society is trained and expected to defend themselves and their lands/city.
If an invader ever attacked one of the warrior society's cities or if the slaves/non-citizens ever revolted the female warrior-citizens would have had to deal with that if all the men were too busy invading the enemy.
But because they are needed to produce the next generation of warriors these women would obviously not have been sent out on campaigns/expeditions (and also Spartan women were trained less brutally than men to prevent accidental deaths because their childbearing ability made them inherently more valuable. They were still trained hard enough that all the Greeks considered Spartan women very attractive because of their physical fitness and Helen of Troy, the 'most beautiful woman in the world', was Spartan).

The Gauls during Caesar's campaigns had female men-at-arms... or militia? Anyways that's a rather sad example as it was total war for the Gauls; everyone was fighting to the end.
The women guarded the back lines and gave moral support but when the men tried to flee from a losing battle they cut them down and the Romans alike, refusing to give ground.",UC7_AZVfo1PhYwh2tZYVmHAg

In most cases women would most likely have not been allowed to be fighters anyway, with rare exceptions, and thus armor for women didn't exist. The greater exceptions consisted of civilizations North of Hadrian's Wall, which mostly used armors consisting of either leather or chainmail, which could conform to any body shape easily. Some didn't wear any armor at all. Otherwise where women weren't allowed to wear armor the only way to get around those restrictions would have likely been removal of their breasts to attempt to pass as a man, or to wrap their chest snuggly in linen bandages in order to press their breasts as flat as they possibly could.",UCowG3t2_EyrP1vWTna-HNNQ

Yes women's armour in movies are fantasy pieces, the goal being looking somewhat warrior-ish (oh look, bits of armor, she clearly fights!) AND sexy. Because clearly, middle age, heroic fantasy etc works of fiction always had ONE target demographic : men and especially young men. And young men loooove to look at sexy women.
There was the 70's and so called ""sexual revolution"" and then the body of women wasn't something to hide anymore . And the 80's, the decade of overdoses in all matters, Nowadays, the same type of people who pushed for women nakedness (hippies, social justice activists), are the same pushing for their covering . This is all very funny. Yes: no matter what you try and push, the ""elite"", the money makers, the exploiters will always find ways to exploit it! If you have the support of mass media it means you're already working for them.

There would have been slight differences in a woman's armor considering that these were always custom made and they would make slight adjustments based on the woman's measurements. One could think that breasts could  therefore change the shape of the armor, but that wouldn't make much sense. If you want a full plate armor to work you need something called a Gambeson. It is basically a padded suits with stuffing. Without a gambeson a full plate armor is useless. Shock waves go through the steel directly in the body. There would be little penetration power, but there would still be a lot physical trauma. A full plate armor is not custome made on your body it is custom made on your body plus gambeson. And when a woman wears such a thick suit, her breasts are compressed and therefore quite negligible for the shape of the plates themselves.",UC6WCC1TJr5Y3kzwLPas3GUA

Myself and others have been pointing out to flaws in the designs, often seeing some design influences from Japanese armor, as far as we know, being put into European style armor. Before hand, the armor was kept at what can be described as very real. Though... As of Awakening... yeah... gone the way of Pop Culture.

Fire Emblem armor has gone through a lot of changes as well. Originally some of the female and male characters only wore what amounted to leather armor that protected roughly only the chest area on both. Now that's been changed to some degree, including remakes. I've noticed that one female type of the game, the Pegasus Knight, as of Fire Emblem Warriors, has gone through yet another change in design.

From leather armor and barely enough protection for either male or female to something plate-like with some even having scale and chain armor to what can only be described as Half Plate Armor and I don't mean the historical sense, where the Pegasus Knight is protected from the waist up and has leg protection and has more, loosely saying, accurate shoulder and upper arm armor, to that latter protection being replaced by just a pair of armored pieces strap to the upper arm in Japanese fashion.

I recall the short lived Fire Emblem anime, saw it a couple years back, but the armored Knights were greatly protected and at one point, were shown deployed in skirmish line fashion, shields up, spears pointed outward with the remaining troops behind them and practically everyone was wearing armor.

They just gave women the same armour but it caused women who were somewhat well endowed a problem. They were just issued bigger vests but after one female officer that I worked with had problems, they had to re-design it. Basically it pressed on the breast so much that some women suffered numbness and this particular colleague found blood on her shirt when she took it off. It turned out that the wire in her bra had worked its way into her breast by 4 inches (100mm!) but due to the tightness all she felt was an itchy sensation. It was solved by putting a dart (an angled seam) of various sizes at the side of the chest area. The armour looked almost indistinguishable from male body armour but increased comfort and safety many times. Interesting video - thank you.",UCuASMdie3kE0iFGj5jt60AQ

If a woman was seen wearing armor, it was likely made for her to dress up in, she'd never fight in it... Women were NOT strong enough physically, to wear full sets of armor historically, and so opted for reduced ""pieces"" of it instead of a full plate set.

Using lighter protective materials instead of Iron or Steel, meant it was more durable, but therefore a lot weaker more useless as actual armor.... This is another reason female armor is stupid.

Armor was designed to be rigid and strong, to deflect weapon blows off of it, time and time again... and to protect it's wearer.

It didn't look like anything, because women didn't go in to battle with any military force that wore actual metal armour. 

As for Joan of Arc, she was a standard bearer, not a soldier, by her own record, she never killed a single man, because she wasn't a soldier. There is just so much shit people have spoken over the years about Joan of Arcs skills as a general & as a fighter, but they are all so much bullshit. She was essentially a mascot, that wasn't even allowed in the planning room most of the time & yes, this is all part of the historical record.

As for the iconography, there is only a single painting of Joan of Arc made that still exists painted during her life time & it was painted san armour.

Such as narrower and more rounded shoulder plates, wider around the ribs and hips,  and also the design would have to take into account that women have a higher center of gravity than men. Also, even though (typically) men are generally stronger, women tend to have more endurance and flexibility, so an armor that was relatively lightweight and allowed for ease of movement would have done well to ensure that the armor did the best it could.",UCEcaWR5lFuGKcvpmaKgLl0w

Yes there were the Rare instances of woman who lead troops, Isabella of France, Joan of Arc but they were sponsored by Rich individuals who could afford to have a suit of armor crafted for their body style. As they used the Blacksmiths that knew how to craft working sets of armor for ""Men"" that is what the suites looked like, they provided the best protection of the time. As to modern ideology of the ""Fantasy"" Breast plate ans skimpy armor, it isn't realistic, it feed the male libido and lets them fantasize about a body type they will probably NEVER get to see up close. I play games like Skyrim, and I prefer to ""role play"" as a female character, it's psychological that we prefer to watch the opposite gender. and I dress the character as realistic as possible.

Second she wasn't condemned by the brits who would have been more than happy to exchange her for money to the french, she was burned by the Catholic Church for these exact words ""dieu premier servit"". The Church wanted her to admit that god's power pass through the pope first, which she denied by saying that she was spoke to directly. They asked her to confess that the pope was the holiest of holies and she said ""dieu premier servit"" (god first served), which was consider a sign of defiance against the church.

The woman wearing the armor was actually quite flat chested and the plate armor was made of thin gold anyway. The reasoning for the breasts was that she was to be leading an army and wanted to make sure they understood she was a woman when looking at her from far away.  Also, 6:45, the anglicization of Jean d'Arc is Joan of Arc. Much the same as the Italian name would be Giovanna di Arco.

Could you say more about ""trousers"" for wariors? At first glance it is a stupid request, but netherless, is there a valid purpose for my question.

Of course we live in an age where women are constantly told that they should be just like men or else they're being oppressed so there are those who will find those kinds of truths to be uncomfortable but the truth isn't always nice or pleasant. This doesn't change the fact that it's true. Women in the military, historical or modern, is an utterly terrible idea. As for female warriors in fiction I personally find it distracting for how inaccurate it is but there is no denying there is a huge market for female playable characters in action and adventure games for example. Armour for females in fiction covers as little of the body as possible whereas Armour for men in fiction tends to cover as much of the person's body as possible. This is because the target audience for such works of fiction are almost always majority 18-30 year old straight men. So the ""armor"" that women wear in fiction isn't designed to be practical for the character in the first place, it's designed to satisfy the target audience, the consumer of the fiction.",UCYySJ9fYaj1E8q2k75kBdZA

Now, I don't mean to bash your video, I agree with everything else your saying. The amount of padding  worn underneath armour would mean the actual 'plate' parts wouldn't require any more customization than a man would need for his individual body type.

I would imagine that, depending on the exact function (guards? soldiers? treasure hunters and thieves who somehow like to wear plate? :P), had many women wanted it, there would have been specific designs... be it to optimize for anatomy, or even to some degree for the reason of vanity.

Mentioning Jeanne D'arc, I have to wonder... she's known to have been wounded twice, by arrow and bolt, in areas one would think are normally covered by full plate. Makes one wonder to what extent she really wore a suit of armor, or perhaps just some basic pieces.

2394,UgiSLo4-v5kfXHgCoAEC,FellOni,"While I understand what you are going for here, you employed the soft bigotry of low expectations at the beginning. It's more plausible that most people understand that female fantasy armor is completely useless. But that isn't the point. You touched on this, but it seems you brushed it aside. Yes, it is attractive in video games for female characters to wear armor that basically has no other function than to look sexy. There are also games that employ female armor that is functional while making them look attractive too, and some that use both. Personally I like both. But in the case of video games it's not just mere functionality we are looking at. While video games are the greatest of meritocracies and anyone can and should enjoy them, it is a market dominated by a male demographic. As such, the industry caters to it, just like any other industry. As anyone should know businesses are in the business of making money, and when you have an industry that makes billions everyone wants a cut of that sweet, tasty, cash. So it would be a great misstep not to properly drive your sales accordingly, and if people don't like it that's fine too. Vote with your wallet. If it becomes obvious that people don't like females in useless armor, I guarantee they will turn that around real quick.

That being said, most video games aren't as egregious in this case as is implied (or as it seems to be implied). The types of games you will see like this typically come from high fantasy eastern games. Which they are not nearly a majority of, especially in the western market. These nonfunctional female armors from western games, are still there but not nearly as exaggerated. The worst offenders, ones that are for nothing but the sex appeal, are usually mods added after the fact by the user of the game.

Just wanted to throw in my knowledge on the subject, as I feel this area of the topic was skirted a bit. It's all personal preference, and no one should not select an armor just because it has no function in the real world. If we want to go that route we could argue why is there magic, dragons, giants, trolls in games?

Now that that's out of the way, it still is interesting to see what armor females in the real world would use for real combat, as they do have a different body type from males. I assumed it would be similar or exactly the same as a male. I take no issue with your historical view on women and armor. Just thought I should clarify.",UCVAcVa6eqVMCTH-jvn5Et7w
2395,UghNT-9f0i852HgCoAEC,hzuiel,"The people trashing this video are exceptional morons. First of all, he isn't saying that lots of women were warriors. Focus on the key points. 

First, armor is designed first and foremost to serve a function. For the same reason a kevlar vest isn't winning any fashion awards, style is the furthest thing from the mind of someone making non-costume/decorative armors, especially expensive plate armors that mostly wealthy people owned. Someone being killed in yoru suit of armor might have ruined your reputation as an armor smith, and reputation was important when dealing with expensive commissions from wealthy individuals who wanted the best armor. This point rings true.

Second, by your own assertion that women didn't frequently take part in combat, obviously if women did wear armor it would've very likely been armor that was designed for men. So again, if women wore armor, it would almost always be as metatron says. I'm not sure if you all realize that by highlighting this you're actually backing up his point, not refuting it.

Although women were not the most common combatants in history, you can bet that women participated in defending against attacks, especially during sieges of large walled cities, and in some cultures even went out to carry out offensive attacks against enemies. At some point in history there were women wearing armor, and in those cases, you would imagine the majority, especially the everyday people, not nobility, would've been wearing armor whatever armor they could find, that was nothing like women's fantasy armor, and was designed primarily for men and defensive purposes, not decorative.",UCCMbZcPRn1YX3gwyNonMH5Q

Women did wear armor as there were female knights fighting during the hundred year war. It's likely that armor was very conservative and as most probably curved out enough to make room for some form of bust, but no where near what fantasy and historical fiction depicts. In fact Koei's Bladestorm game probably shows the most realistic armor seen in video games for women as you won't ever see anyone in bikinis and shows a good example of what women would have worn on the battle field. Albeit they would have had helmets, unlike the game.",UC7F4eWsyANK2CfazyJRLZ8g

Jean D'Arc was a farmer or daughter of farmer family, as far as i can remember, on those days people that were not noble didn't had that much to eat  and i believe on military campaigns food wasn't abundant either so she tend to be thin and due muscle i mass increase she would tend to be  small breasted, more of the kind (not exactly) as an olympic gymnast or swimmer (you know what i mean right?)

 In the other hand, we have to take into consideration that she had to ""disguise"" as a male to enter the army at least in the beginning so she had to find a way to conceal any sign that could uncover she was actually a woman (she had to cut her hair on the typical hair style for example). After they started winning battles they probably didn't care, they were winning and she had supposedly  a task assigned by god.

Anyways another thing i want to point is that Jean D'Arc, the person, may be real as yes, maybe she really existed but there's also Jean D'Arc the myth, the stories that spread  around through word of mouth on a quite dark era of humanity.",UCCjJEAYMOmPeN9hSj99k1ZA

In spite of that, it was widely used in the antiquity. Protection isn't always the sole purpose of an armour - I believe that more often than not, the opposite is true. So it makes sense to me that in a world where female armours are common, a specific artistic style would develop, which might well resemble the Greek and Roman muscle cuirasses, imitating the actual body of its wearer (or an idealised version of it), including bulges on the chest representing the female breasts. Obviously very slight and ""modest"" ones, not exaggerated boobplates like in the armours shown in the video, and we're still in the realms of fantasy and fiction. 
In case of the European middle ages, where a female armour is an absolute rarity (like the one belonging to Joanne of Arc), it would have obviously been crafted just like any other contemporary armour because: 
a) muscle cuirasses weren't used anymore - the physical body of both men and women wasn't given an artistic value in the christian society, so there was no reason to make them, 
b) the craftsmen could only work with what they knew, which was the male armour, since no female armours were around.",UChEiYAOexgMhOzh0W0y7pgA

Now imagine you are a king, or a general leading your troops to the field. Full armours were a very very expensive piece of equipement, Very few could afford and fighting was more a feudal duty than a hobby. If a kingdom or a lord was desperate enough to put women in the battlefield, they would be militia, or bowers. Both jobs do not require a life of training, and in most places it was illegal even dressing as men (men used to play women roles even in theatre)

(Her Wikipedia entry shows a portrait of her in armour of 1485, which is only a few decades after her death.)  Were there any others?   In 12th century England the Empress Matilda (a courtesy title as widow of the Holy Roman Emperor Henry V) was involved in a civil war with King Stephen for the crown of England, but I don't know if she actually led her forces in battle, let alone whether she wore armour.  Oddly enough, King Stephen's wife, Matilda of Boulogne, does seem to have led her husband's forces while he was in captivity. Going back further in time, the Lady Aethelflaed of Mercia (daughter of King Alfred of Wessex) was noted as a military leader. The only other example I can think of is Margaret of Anjou (the She-Wolf of France), wife of King Henry VI of England, who took part in the Wars of the Roses.  The recent BBC version of Shakespeare's historical plays shows  her (played by the great Sophie Okonedo) frequently in armour, but I don't know if there is any historical evidence for this.  On a quick search I found this list of 10 fighting women http://www.medievalists.net/2014/07/20/ten-medieval-warrior-women/  but apart from Joan only a few are portrayed in armour.",UCKe4IO_sG5dP3WeTA7UXkMQ

So I set my sights on crafting a leather Cuirass (torso) made of 9 oz leather with a very thin layer of padding glued on the inside covered with a low fleece nap. To top it off I dyed it black and lacquered the hell out of it. 
I was so proud. My first attempt at leather craft came out just the way I wanted it to, and it fit like a glove with those built in breast cups. 
However my moment of pride quickly faded when I took it on the field for it's first test drive against a dude so tall he blotted out the sun.  To make matters worse his weapons were like telephone poles (max length for one handed weapons in the sport). 
His reach was monstrous, but I was little and quick so I kept moving him around at the edge of his range till I could catch him out of position. Finally he threw a shot where I was able to block and move in at the same time. His shiny helmet was wide open to my left, so I punched my right hand weapon up, pivoted my wrist and went for the cross temple shot that was open to me...and then nothing. The inside of my bicep/triceps hit the dynamic wall of breast cup and bungled the shot.  Needless to say that match didn't end well for me but that lesson led to a long study of what works and what doesn't work for armored protection on women.",UCiLpgEDWXcYWhunr6KV_i8A

I do think it would be great if you or someone else made a historical video on women in warfare. Surely, there was at least one example in each medieval and classical society that depicted the ladies fighting, too.

1.) Yes, they did use shields in the 14th-16th century. even a knight in a full plate harness could and would use a shield, just generally smaller than the image you depicted and it was as much a weapon as it was protection.
2. Joan of Arc... while you are using common iconography, the armor depicted is about 300 years after she lived. in her time she would have worn Maille and MAYBE a coat of plates,  so while the armor WAS the same as a mans, it was not a ridged defense.
3. the bigger problems with breast cups on plate is less about it guiding blows to the neck and more with it not distributing the blow properly. A gorget would solve the issue of blows to the neck, but a blunt weapon strike to the chest, even with a moderately padded gambison, would still drive a now focused point of impact into your sternum. you basically turn it into a wedge for splitting your ribs.",UCQPBTe4CzLzPPaz-JnGWXIw

2971,UgieEnMUpaT913gCoAEC,ShadowVulcan,"I agree from that, from a functional standpoint, female armor should, and very likely was, identical to male armor. Though, I do have two points that go against this belief. The first is that, from a historical standpoint, you rarely hear about female warriors, so it would stand to reason that most armor smiths wouldn't bother to make custom pieces for females unless they were paid more. So, in effect, if female warriors had the money for custom pieces, or if there were specialized armorers for the female form, then actual female armor might look different. The second point is, I would believe, a small reason why female breast plates, or skin tight armor in general, accentuate the female for in games and movies is that it helps people to recognize individuals better. Should they be in chain mail underwear? No, but showing a distinctive difference between males and females in armor would help people to identify with them more or identify specific characters. So, instead of trying to disseminate which armored blob is which a person can see small gender generalities to identify whom is who and then match them up with more specific characteristics. Like the board game ""Guess Who"" where you can eliminate a good portion by asking ""Is your character male or female?""",UCc6h7J2iuSsV7rv3D0ns0-w
2972,Ughyf2r4JANWXXgCoAEC,꧁Sp00n꧂,"Why would you have plate armor on top of mail armor? (2:49) O.o
A gambeson is legit, as you said, for padding. You can mix them by covering up some parts with plate and other parts with mail (mainly articulations/joints, because they would lose mobility with plate), but not both at the same time. Full mail is 30kg, full armor is 30kg. Medieval people are still normal people, in the way that even trained medieval men or women won't run around on a battlefield covered up in 60kg of armor and swinging a sword (+ maybe a shield?) for as long as a battle lasts, which can mean hours.

In addition to the fact that it would require insane physical condition to do that: using plate on top of mail adds least benefit to the mail, as they both protect you from getting cut. The impact would stay very similar, no matter what armor type you wear, and combining them would make you lose more mobility, than it would add protection.

Anyways, good point on female/male armor, loved that vid' :3",UCTidBnWaY12ML2jbOetJurA

The thing is, ""What did female armour look like?"" It looked like... I dunno, non-existent? The societies that had full-body plate armor didn't allow their women to fight in battles. ""But the Vikings!"" Read again please, I specifically spoke of ""Societies that had Full-body PLATE armor"". Yes, the Vikings had their maidens in battles, this is true. Completely true because Viking women(believe it or not) had to be able to fend off other male Vikings. They were barbarians for a reason you know?

Anyway, back to the subject, women weren't allowed to go to battle. This video, while enjoyable to watch, made me facepalm at the sheer amount of misinformation that I'm perceiving(Let's leave Feminism out of this, I can rant about that for aeons to pass). If you have a source that corrects me on the matter(please, a credible one), by all means link me to it. There were matters that he was correct in that, in the rare instances of Jeanne D'arc for example,  when a woman did fight in full plate armor, it was exactly the same as their male counterparts. HOWEVER, Jeanne D'arc wasn't burned for simply being a French footsoldier, not for the fact that she fought against the English. She was burned, for CROSSDRESSING AS A MALE SOLDIER! In those times, it was punishable by death to pretend being male.

I have to give him credit for his... ridiculing? of literal breast armour, though I wouldn't say it was as much as a vital hazard(it is... but I'm looking from a different perspective, one even before a battle) as it is a resource devourer. No, seriously, I've seen someone bowl out female breast armour and it's ridiculous how much material is being used to make those cups. So not only is it impractical due to high lethality ratings, it's also inefficient as it costs too much to make and unreasonable as you could use the wasted resources to make more armours.

So, the CORRECT answer to ""What did female armours look like"" is: They don't exist. Culture-wise, it was male dominated which means any woman that would be on the battlefield would be wearing male armour and afterwards burned to death due to sacrilege(Yes, I'm fun at parties!) and the few cultures that allowed women on the battlefield were often dressed in leather or fur armour. The reason why video game designers go for the ""Metal bikini"" or the exaggerated breastplate is simply because there is no real world equivalent. And at that point, realism in a fantasy game goes out the door and the metal bikini come swooping onto the female character's mammaries.",UCxxFdH-goXnGeh_sgjMJ92w

However, when it comes to the ""breast(s)plate"" and the skin-tight look, would the same count for leather armor aswell? I mean, underneath a leather armor you could wear only a piece of cloth. Also the ""skimpy"" leather armor wouldnt be less protective against Weapons, as most weapons just penetrate leather without much effort.

3084,Ugh-7VDKJ2dT5ngCoAEC,Fylgija,"I'd love to know from any enthusiasts here if this sounds at all viable; just a curious idea that's been floating around in my head for years. I've often contemplated in my leisure time how I would design the ultimate type of medieval armour most resistant to puncture, and I came up with this: 

You know how a sphere is most ideally-shaped to absorb the most amount of force, like how you can stand on a carton of egg shells? What if you made the plate armour moderately thinner, placed the chainmail over-top, having each link in the chain going through solid metal ball-bearings that are so closely packed together that they're touching. 
The reason it goes over top is that - whereas the plate used to handle the shock while the mail averted the puncture - the ball-bearing chainmail would now mostly take over both duties. The breast plate would be underneath it because to have any shock-absorption, they'd need to hit a plate on the back. 

Then, the reason the breast plate resting *under* it is moderately thinner is because another plate would need to go on top as well. This would prevent stabbing strikes from simply hitting the ball and slipping in-between them. So two thinner plates with ball bearing chainmail in-between, who's shock absorption should be massively amplified well-beyond the lost protection of more metal mass. 

But finally, to compensate for weaker links in-between (directly accessible or not), have much teeny-tinier ball bearings between the primary ones and the top-layer breast plate, melted to fuse the mail to the top plate (not the bottom plate, as that would relegate more shock absorption to the top plate before channelling through the ball-bearings).

Just as a carton full of egg shells can hold a grown man's weight, but the stronger cardboard carton itself could not, I see this as a way to both reduce the weight of the armour and drastically increase the shock and penetration resistance.",UComycFr8wQP4Vea94Qbg6iQ

Those paintings of Joan D'arc in ""female armor"" are just as much fantasy as anything you see in games and movies. In the contemporary images of Joan D'arc she's just wearing regular clothes and a sword and a banner.


In mosaics where you can see Gladiatrix, they seem to be either bare chested and wearing only a loincloth, or they are wearing equivalent of bra and panties.

You can find plenty of images of Henry VIII in armor, you can find images of James VI and I in armor. But you can't find images of either Elizabeth I or Mary the Queen of Scots in armor. Except when they are from movies. In fact you can find images of Mary the Queen of Scots being the only person in the painting without wearing an armor.

3195,Ugi-8ibXsycl0ngCoAEC,Christopher Miller,"The armor clearly fit your model very poorly, but that's mostly because it was designed for someone much larger. Considering how rare it was for a woman to be on the field of battle, any armor designed for a woman to wear would almost certainly have been custom-fitted. It would have been required to be smaller in general and have a fairly significant difference in proportions at the shoulders, waist, and hips. Thigh and knee protection would need to be re-engineered as well, since a woman's legs are built just a slight bit different. A female stride might cause pinching or binding at the knee joints in plate designed for a male.

Still, point made. Another good example would be how Brienne of Tarth is depicted in Game of Thrones. Her armor is not for a male- too narrow at the shoulders for a man of equal size, but the chestpiece is flat. In fact, when she is gifted with a new suit, there is mention that it will need to be altered for her, and they didn't mean adding cups.

Even lighter/earlier armors such as hardened leather wouldn't have shown any obvious signs of female anatomy, as one can be almost certain that a female warrior would have bound her breasts down for the same reasons male athletes wear jock straps.

3264,UgiAR9Jo8b2BhHgCoAEC,whatfireflies,"Here's my explanation of why female fantasy armour looks like fancy metal bikini. I actually think it makes a lot of sense, in a twisted ""fantasy vs. reality"" kind of way.
Let's start with the observation that warriors need to look scary: they need to incute fear in their opponents. This is as much for the psychological benefit of the warrior himself, than for the effect it may have on his opponent. One could presume it is at least as important as the warrior's capacity to attack and defend.
One proof lies in the many instances of ""battle paint"" found in various cultures throughout the ages, which give no advantage whatsoever in attack or defense, but were clearly deemed necessary for a warrior to wear.
Now, we all know that a good way for a man to incute fear is to look strong and invulnerable, which in a fantasy production would take the shape of heavy plate armour and a ""tank"" look.
What is a good, nay, bulletproof way for a woman to incute fear into her male and female opponents alike? Why, it's obviously a sexy and sexually aggressive look! Hence metal bikini and all the other variations of S&M wear routinely seen in fantasy art, movies, and games.

Or maybe it's just fan service.

If you're wearing plate then you should be covered pretty much everywhere. In leather almost all places should be covered in leather and anywhere that isn't should have cloth. I figure this can be done to allow for higher flexibility. And then I suppose if you're wearing cloth  coverage really isn't an issue since it's not gonna be doing anything in the first place.,UCuPhXLq9y0uu9CqM28mHHVQ

3303,UghZtHwmyFEigHgCoAEC,RealityBreaker,"plate armour would really suck if you were not a close quarters combatant. Or even if you were these days we can look back and say that plate armour is pathetic and could have easily be improved by removing a tone of the unnecessary plates and regain some mobility. Some female armour is actually more effective since it allows significantly more mobility. If mobility is what you are after then plate armour would just get you killed.

Think about it logically. men are physically stronger and less mobile so it really doesn't matter very much if they lose the mobility and in large scale conflicts it really wouldn't help for a woman who is already physically disadvantaged with strength to be made to sacrifice her mobility, flexibility and any chances of getting out of the battle field and home to her family alive.

Of course I am not saying that this
http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--OArWx9Zg--/18j1weqsh8k74jpg.jpg 
armour would be used since it is obviously just simply useless however for me as an experienced martial artist who often fights with nothing but thin clothing which gets stained by either my or someone else's blood every other week I know that if I wore plated armour it would be a death sentence and I would just simply go onto the battle field in my shorts alone since I would have a higher chance of survival by kicking and punching my way through the hordes of people who have next to no mobility.

I am saying that this armour

Would be wasted on a woman who would simply end up dying after at most killing 4 to 5 men however most likely being one of the first to die from being overpowered by physical strength and with no other way to win being killed by a physicaly stronger man.

To be fair it would also be wasted on this guy
http://www.dorktees.com/ultimate-nerd-quiz/images/img9.jpg

So use a little but of knowledge before you start talking about armour. Women in a fight would prioritise mobility so any sort of clothing around joints would if possible never be metal or thick leather and if possible nothing at all. Of course protect your heart and gut but apart from that all you need to do is train your ability to dodge better then the man who trained his physical ability to cut other men in big armour down. But is isn't like women don't have decent armour. 

https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=bad+womens+armour&espv=2&biw=1366&bih=667&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwinvL-t3vfLAhVJOxoKHQnYDk4Q_AUIBigB#tbm=isch&q=women+armour&imgrc=_

I looked long and hard but most women's armour is acutely ""Decent"" and works ok however like I said it wouldn't help their mobility. The few not good women's armour I found were 90% people complaining about women;s armour and 10% actually bad armour that should never be used unless you are trying to have fun your significant other behind closed doors.

Sure you get some fantacy MMO games that have you take off armour for more defence however that could either just be down to the game devs wishing to sell to a very specific and sad demographic or it is the game devs actually realising that women are actually more mobile and flexible then men meaning that they could gain extra mobility to avoid attack.",UC24KXFJBXyWiSRaeSeE-v0Q

Half naked armors are basically doing nothing at all besides adding weight to your body. I can understand the hormones young men would have though, think any man went trough that horny hell at some point in their teens. It just does not make it true that being half naked is equal to heavy armor, or any armor at all for that matter.

I however do need to add that it could be plausible for both women as men to wear 'leather armor' that protected specific body parts, but most likely for for other reasons. If you look at a blacksmith for example you can clearly see he would need something to protect himself against the hot coals and flames while doing his job. But being armor... nope.

3367,Ugg_j7oLJ0GK3ngCoAEC,Dani Flunky Cook,"Le armature ""femminili"" sono sessualizzate perchè una grande fetta degli amanti del fantasy è composta da pubblico maschile e della parte restante femminile cerca un facile approccio in uno stile ""femminile"" nelle armature, solo una piccola parte apprezza realmente lo stile funzionale ed asessuato delle armature così come le conosciamo. In generale è difficile vedere personaggi femminili in armatura d'acciaio, è una questione culturale se vuoi, ma l'armatura ""funzionale"" è d'interesse medievale, non fantasy. nel fantasy il concetto di funzionale non esiste nemmeno la maggior parte delle volte, sia in eccesso (piastre d'acciaio ovunque, anche dove dovrebbero esserci le articolazioni senza il ""cuff"", o all'interno delle mani ad esempio) sia in difetto (come le armature aperte per fare vedere i muscoli/scollature o l'ombelico femminile perchè...boh.) ma è così per personaggi maschili e femminili, basti vedere film come 300, il fantasy è fatto per essere bello, e la figura femminile nelle sue forme o maschile nelle sue sono belli. 

Detto questo io sono il primo a criticare le armature oversessualizzate, personalmente non trovo sconvolgenti la forma dei seni nel breastplate, ma non tollero la pancia scoperta o scollature profonde o spacchi sulle cosce.

3391,UghyDRndv7uMjHgCoAEC,Alexandra Lantz,"Perhaps the best place to look for what the differences in armors are is modern day armor, because, well, we have the most information about it! The US just recently redesigned their standard full armor especially for women, so there's been a lot of talk about it, and other countries already have designs for their female soldiers. 

The primary differences between male armor and female armor: 

- Narrow shoulders and smaller armholes (because even a bulky woman has, proportionally, much smaller arms than a man)
- Shorter body (apparently a big problem for female US soldiers was getting bruises on the hips where the armor would hit them when they marched)
- Shaping (in the cloth/kevlar armor this is done with darts) to give a bit more space in front while still coming in snug at the waist (not much more space mind you! Boobs are just usually not as big as in the fantasy games! Especially when you have them locked down tight enough to actually be able to move comfortably without them bouncing everywhere (my biggest problem with the ""boob plate"" as all your bad examples are often called is it looks *so* uncomfortable to have them separated and up in your face like that when you're moving around a lot! Think of how a well-fitting sports bra looks... flat!)

The US armor also added a notch in the back neck plate large enough to accommodate a short pony tail or bun. I guess those women with the really long hair in the images you showed would braid their hair or put it in a large bun. It would have to sit very low in order to be outside the helmet and honestly would be very uncomfortable. Another option would be to design the helmet with extra space so that you could tuck all of the hair into the helmet. However, I think the unusual shape this would cause might decrease its effectiveness at protection. The final option would be to put a hole in the helmet just big enough to stick a pony tail through. Then you don't even need to add a plume on the helmet! 

However, I imagine real woman warriors would cut their hair, because hair that long is just not very practical for moving around a lot especially when you need to squeeze it in between a helmet and a gorget. And even tied up it's a risk for getting grabbed or caught on something, and most women's hair won't stay tied up through vigorous activity no matter how you try. So the super long hair is unfortunately also just a product of fantasy!",UCp5ktvKoxyLKQ69QxxfI3Sg

But you cannot compare games to real life as the games are just a visual and entertaining distraction to real life. If you truly wish to get a idea of good quality armour look to either the Romans with multiple small plate pieces that allowed more movement and more  importantly that flexibility allowed the absorption of arrow impact in some cases, much more so than the English or Spanish type one chest piece which arrows tended to penetrate.Also the armour of the Japanese Samurai with more or less no metal in it actually gave excellent protection from the weapons of the time. It is somewhat like trying to shoot an arrow or stab a sword through a phone book. However for games despite the lack of real protection I will take the various sexy styles they have.

I do know this method was used here in America quite a bit. Armor wasn't used at the time but women were used as spies because they were less likely to be executed even after being caught multiple times. Some Native American tribes used women when negotiating with the Spanish because they were less likely to be shot.

3490,Ugh4Bd8veG6sT3gCoAEC,orztaku,"well, kinda depends on whether the game wants to be somewhat historical or not. A game like....Terra (or similar comic/anime based games) it's completely pointless. But games like Dark Souls or The Elder Scrolls is a different story.

After all, historically armored armies ( be it greek, roman or middle ages) would only bring women as ""morale support"". Real warrior women were extremely rare. 

1. walking around in full armor, with a medieval blade and maybe even shield would require alot of strength training, so it's safe to assume that Jeanne D'Arc looked more like Conan then a real women, making the triple H-Cup ""Breastplate"" pretty useless and empty.

2. as correctly stated, warriors would wear some heavy cloth to cussion the blows (the armor stops the blade, but not the impact, so a direct hit can easily crush ur rips), followed by chain shirts (or possibly mail). Both are quite heavy pretty much flattening any soft tissue beneath (read breasts). Making the ""Steel tits"" even less useful.

3. neither rome, greece nor medieval states knew ""custom made"" as we do today. All armor was made in the same basic shape, merely adjusted if the client was a bit to fat to fit in (and had the money to pay). The only true difference was decorations.  Taking that and the fact that armored women were all but common, there was no market for ""Breast plates"" and as such, even the knowledge and skills needed to craft one were never developed. 

So all in all it should be pretty obvious that games and movies cater to the needs of the audience rather then historical accuracy. After all it's business .",UCGG0wkZiU_2Tw1I0RFKf9bQ

3504,Ugh-JfFaK4IAVngCoAEC,FyrexNL,"The argument mainly boils down to nothing but the aesthetics of Armour in media. And it's nothing more then a subjective personal opinion of what you want to see yourself. If we take games as a example, then protection is not determined by whether or not a piece of armour ""looks"" like it might be functional, it's solely determined by it's stats. That piece of conan cloth will be far better at protecting you, if it's a really high level piece of armour then say a set of full plate armour that is really low level. It's all about the stats. So an argument of ""realism"" simply falls flat in that regard. So it all boils down to aesthetics.

As to the question posed at 5:22, my answer is no, it does not look sexy TO ME personally. Personally, and I stress this, personally, I like my armours to look completely over the top, stylish, sexy and/or cool.

3506,UgjQ492tVj-yDXgCoAEC,Jolly Voqar,"The whole argument is completely stupid, since almost no RPG games model reality, and are entirely fantasy.  In fantasy or sci fi, why would armor ever have to be truly protective when magic, force fields, or other hidden variables could be providing more protection than you can see?

The most basic example of all is the ring of protection from D&D - a ring that boosts your armor even though it's a tiny band on one finger.  That thong could easily be a thong +10, pushing more armor value than full plate coverage of generic metal armor (without all that encumbrance).  That micro bra could have a force field coming from it that repels nuclear weapons.  Those nipple covers could be pushing out invisible to the eye nanotech providing huge layers of protection.

You're ok with elves, orcs, trolls, mythical beasts, dragons, make believe gods and events, magic, psionic powers, and everything else that goes with fantasy and sci-fi, right?  So why do you think armor should adhere to medieval convention?  It's utter idiocy.  Fantasy and Sci-fi are genres about imagination and some people want to shut that down and try to bring in reality.  Phaw!

If you are against scantily clad women, that's one thing.  Make a better argument and/or deny the other reality that most gamers are men that want to see half naked women and marketing/designing is done to get sales thru that (and many women are ok with glorifying the female form, going back thru all of art history even).   But to try to say that armor in a make believe setting needs to actually provide coverage or protection is stupid and defies the basic deviance from reality of fantasy and/or sci-fi.",UCm4jbvGJcFpopLNFjWFyWmg

If it wasn't ornamental, like what a king would commission for himself, and we're talking standard uniform, men and women would be given the same pieces of armour to work with. Some may have personalized their pieces, as many warriors would, but a smith would never spend more time producing a breastplate with actual breasts for one common soldier, then a regular flat plate for another. Also, armour, back when it was a prominent form of defense, wasn't as commonplace as people think. Full plate mail was so expensive that only the highest of nobles bought it, and rarely ever wore it into actual battle (don't want a possible family heirloom being plundered on the battlefield). Leather, chainmail, splint, scale, and studded armours were wide spread, and those are basically all one size fits all in most cases.",UCwPTH4XWQk2j3-Ujn60nilg

However, realism is not why I play fantasy games (Dragon Age is also a game that represents armour as realistic in style too) and recall mages in RPG's like AD&D loading up with rings, necklaces, robes and whatever 'of Protection' to give them an chance of avoiding a hit - something even warriors used to cut down on their encumbrance. The magic items covered nothing but helped characters avoid or dodge or simply magically deflector alter the direction of incoming missiles and blows.

2) furthermore if you pay attention 2 the same region you'll discover the exact same issue with all the mens 1 piece platebody that covers the full upper torso, 

3) theres ALWAY'S Layering... sometimes the only purpose platebody is supposed 2 have is 2 efficiantly protect the more vital areas without weighing sed soldier down, also as a replacment for platebody you can have steel sticks binded 2 your chainmail and if hit it will push your arm back and even if it breaks 1 of the sticks it will have 2 go threw 2 or 3 more just 2 come close 2 cuting your hand/arm off. 

i would personaly wear layered  chainmail with steel sticks binded, like 3-5 layers each layer with steel sticks 1 layer has the sticks pointing up and the other has them going side ways, this would make for verry protective & efficiant light armor then where something along the lines of some small plate patchs,

like a HQ plate over my heart, a couple of HQ plates over my lower and mid lungs, and elbows and a plate that cover's my bladder, because a plain old bear handed strike to that area can permanently cripple a man immagine geting cut or stabbed there.

although the shoulders can be left to the steel sticks and hard leather/chainmail sleeve's.

3604,Ugjw_dtOkFo1JHgCoAEC,ScorieDivine,"Nice vid. Meaning nice italian hottie partner. A few sidenotes thoughs :
A] Jeanne d'Arc was not ""left for the Brits to burn her at the stake without the French doing anything"". She was, in fact, purposefully sold by Frenchmen (Burgundians, in particular Jean II de Luxembourg, comte de Ligny) to the Brits, for this exact purpose of burning, in order to hurt the Armagnac propaganda

As for the Armagnac, Charles VII and his loyalist party, he was only too happy of being delivered of what had become a burden and a source of tension between himself and the Pope. In the end, the Burgundians were paid and took out a symbol of their enemies, the King was free of a cumbersome ally without having to bring his proto-galliconist clergy to an impopular state. And the people found in this execution (a treachery whose ignominy was seemingly endorsed by the English), even more reasons to kick their ugly arses back to the ugly pile of sterile rock they like to call home.

The truth of the matter is the death of Jeanne was a heavily political question, and as such, carefully (if crually) based on pragmatic views.

B] The shield did not disappear because the plate armor was rendering it useless, it disappeared because the gear at this time was too heavy to easily manoeuver one, and the first fireweapons were making it obsolete. A shield has 2 purposes :
- Protecting you from distant weapons during the charge. Which is pointless when bullets pierce through it)
- Protecting you when swordfighting on foot. Chich was not an option from the XVth century and on because the armor had become too heavy for most knights to even get back on their feet in the eventuality of a fall. Hence why they prefered a good long spear to a heavy shield which would not even protect them during the charge.",UCLbaDyn8buUltzky2ws80yw

First off is armor weight. Men can generally carry more weight then women and thus can carry the burden of more steel surrounding their body. 

Second is flexibility. Women are generally more flexible and more agile then men and if wearing steel plates in the most mobile of areas then that flexibility wanes. This actually presents another problem as well with a combination the first point I made. Women want that flexibility as with a blow taken might put them out after only 1. They want to be able to dodge and only protect what is absolutely vital witch is head and chest.

Considering the attitude of men 400+ years ago, no woman in armor would want ever want to be identified as a woman.   Maybe women are still out there fighting but they're masquerading as boys or young men.  A known woman on the battlefield almost certainly risks rape.  Perhaps even by soldiers from her own side.

In a classic 'low fantasy' setting where magic is nonexistent, I can see your gripes about armor like this in games. However human sexuality is universal despite era, location, or culture. In any setting where you have magic armor, I guarantee you some aspiring wizard has done the plate bikini, and it was even more protective than a mundane one. And high heels... on their steel boots.

Why? Because in every culture *capable* of prizing form without sacrificing the function of an object, it's immediately defaulted to the most sexualized version of that object acceptable by the cultural consensus (or even when not, as in the case of the use of thongs and brassieres in middle ages peasantry despite the prohibitions of the church)

So yes, I see your point that completely form concealing plate armor is *Historical*. But at the same time it's utterly irrelevant in games, which is the whole subject of your gripe. As long as there is magic, and a pervert willing to make it, bikini armor is just as likely and believable as concealing plate. In fact, the absence of it strains my disbelief.",UCZNLkCwGsnlKocXzP4PNekw
3737,Ugh5Ka8QZPzRT3gCoAEC,74greendemon,"In history it allways was the men who go into battle (some exeptions). So the armors were made for men, esspecially when mass produced for the normal soldier. Like one or two sizes fits all. It would not make sense to produce armor for women back then. So if a women was wearing an armor, she was wearing a men armor. Also, the technology and tools back then were not able to build a good working armor for women because it would need to be a bit lighter without any disadvantage of protection to be able to fight against a men. Same for the men, only the strong enough men could handle the weight of the armor. Todays weapons and armors by far don't need that much brute force so more women (and men) can easly use it.",UCSZiiHPYne9OCotbtFQdSaw

Women can look attractive in almost anything they wear if designed right it sometimes takes more work, or the skimpy armour is just a preference for the artist or designer, So while i would encourage more people to think up real armour designs we must keep in mind these are made up stories already.

3867,Ughiwo9_aFyytHgCoAEC,Cloud Skunk Random Nonsense,"I think it's funny that you're actually pretending women, back in the day, wore armor as regularly (even a little) as men did.

Back in the day, we *really did* have a patriarchy.  It was called the Church of England.  And back then, the amount of women actually wearing armor into battle was so ridiculously small that you probably could've counted them on your fingers and toes between the years 0 AD and 1700 AD.  Conscription, traditionally, has been directed towards men.  Impression, traditionally, has been directed towards men.  95% of all recorded combat death statistics (meaning fighter versus fighter) are men.  Wanna know why that is?

Because women are physically incapable of wearing *and* fighting in the types of armor that these knights you're referring to were fighting in.  Jesus dude, even you and I are probably incapable of fighting in these types of armor that these knights you're referring to were fighting in.  Even in your silly little pretend-sword-fighting-practice-sessions, none of you little pricks are wearing full underarmor, full chain mail, full plate mail, swinging around a sword or mace as heavy as they were using back in the day.

For you to sit there and pretend that women were some kind of effective fighting force back in the day is not only historically inaccurate, it's politically disingenuous.  

Here's a thought exercise for you.  Take the very BEST player in the NBA today and put him against the very BEST player in the WNBA in a 1v1 situation.  Who do you think is going to come out on top more, if they play, say, ten matches?  Probably, the vast majority of the time, the NBA player is going to come out on top, and it has everything to do with the fact that he's taller, faster, more physically apt to participating in a basketball match than a smaller, weaker, slower person is.  Why do you think they don't allow women into the NBA?

For the same reasons that women never really fought on the battlefield, Joan of Arc style, historically, the way you're playing them off to have.  I guarantee you that if any girl back then had suited up and went up against a fully trained, marshaled knight, she'd get her god damn neck broken.",UCERt9s4ZvSAdu_3hRh42a7A

3891,UghgXKW5k9czbHgCoAEC,BigotesMcbuff,"Considering the fact that women in the battle field were extremely rare and that ringmail and especially plate armour was worn only by noblemen (working with metals was expensive in terms of resources and expertise, only specialised blacksmiths could make a piece of said armour, let alone a full suit), apart from the great historical figure of Joan of Arc, a woman of nobility that had to hide her gender to be able to go to war, there really isn't vast archeological records of women in battle and therefore we can only base our understanding of female armor on that one case or on ceremonial Norse female armor.
I realize there is a push for a rewriting of history by the feminist movement, as well as by fanboys with a penchant for strong female figures and let's be honest, who doesn't like to see a couple of gals wrestling, and you have a push to make fantasy into reality.
Strong female figures, sexy ones not the whiny, weak, selfish and tantrum-throwing kind, have been a male fantasy from long ago. It's not surprising that Joan of Arc was elevated to almost the figure of a saint. A woman, the mother of the country fighting to protect her 'children', all sexy and feminine and kickass in her gear and sword.
I personally like strong women and they've formed part of my life all along. Women are loved for all their strengths and frailties, and they shine when they extend their natural maternal instincts beyond their children and into those around them (eg. Maxim Gorki's ""Mother"").
Insofar as roleplaying, go nuts with anything you like unless you're roleplaying Joan of Arc, in which case if you want to stick to historical accuracy, you may have to stick to a certain look.
I haven't attended a Renaissance fair although it's on my bucket list, but I can only imagine armoured people won't stick to the look of the foot soldier, made up of peasants wearing leather and lances, or a few artisans wearing studded leather and an old family weapon that belonged to their great grandfather with a tiny minority of noblemen in plate.

1. Video games armor for women is bullshit.
2. Women need DIFFERENT armor, because their bodies are different. Not just the chest, also the hips, the thinkness of the legs, the waist ratio, etc. All of these things make it very hard for a woman (especially rounder ones) to wear an armor especially made for men. WOMEN need extra space in the chest plate, if that is in the rudimentary form of boobs that's fine (Although I do see your point with swords deflecting to the throat). Even the girl admits it's tight. Then says it fine, but what if she actually had to fight in it? I bet heavy breathing will make it REALLY tight...

My melee toons are serious fighters, not hotties out for pixel chasing, so they are covered, fully armored. Unless in a BG I rarely have helms visible and I prefer not to have cloaks visible except on my rdps caster toons. I have a tough time visualizing mediaeval fighters with long cloaks swirling around their ankles during on-the-ground melee. I would think Cloaks could be dangerously in the way or give an opponant something to grab ahold of.

The same applies in games, basically there are many kinds of Fantasy, one's that try to realistic and have excellent armours for men and women and one's that are just trying to make things sexy and fun and to hell with practicality, really if you don't like it, don't buy it.

What you absolutely should do is buy the heck out of the practical fantasy games, to make sure there are plenty about, the only reason why unpractical is more popular is because it sells more, sex sells, will always sell, will never change because sex is hardwired into our instincts, we are just animals with higher cognitive function that doesn't always work as well as we would like.

TL:DR Talking is good, it's good to see how women's armour really was, which is pretty much the same as men's, people like practical and non practical armour and that's totally cool, it depends on what fantasy genre you like, buy what you like to encourage more of it.",UCsHB5mKsu-48QGOxZzUfyWg

As long as the armor is the correct size there is no real reason women's armor should be any different from a males. Any concerns with breasts would logically be handled by clothing under the armor rather than the armor itself, as it much easier to design and tailor cloth to hold breasts together than it is to design and smith metal to do that job.

Of course with all that being said I can not believe anyone would suggest that real plate armor is even close to being as sexy as fantasy bikini armor. A beautiful woman is going to be beautiful no mater what you put her in, but unless you just have an armor fetish there is no argument to be made that plat armor accentuates that beauty in any way.

The history of female warriors in europe is very short, most female warriors from between 5th and 14th century were from Middle East and from Asia or Africa and they didn't were any armor at all (except maybe in Japan and in China). There are some historical reports about norse shield maidens and such, but most of the female warriors in Europe and Scandinavia were mostly military leaders and strategists.  If armor was used in battle, it was pretty much unisex - same kind of armoring for both genders.

No?.......................................... Talk about exaggerating and stereotyping an entire industry.....................
In the vast majority of cases too. In the games where women do dress in revealing armor, the men usually run around half naked too. It's usually very high fantasy and not intended to be realistic at all.
People literally end up complaining about women wearing MORE armor than men. If a man can get away with running around half naked, then so can women. And in most cases when they're actually trying to be more realistic, women wear the exact same armor.
Dragon Age Origins is a great example of this. Heck, I am playing a realm reborn right now, and the armor identical. And it's a Japanese MMO, and there's a lot of stereotypes about Japanese MMOs....
It's just rather annoying when people complain about revealing armor, when in the exact same game. You have men running around on open battlefields wearing NOTHING but a loincloth, and the women ironically actually wear MORE protection.

 Even if the choice is yours in a game, people will STILL complain about it.
If you have the option and can make the decision for yourself what you want your character to look like. People will just on purpose ignore the full suits of armor and go '' ermaghurd, look! LOOK! ALL ARMOR IS SKIMPY AMAGAD! ''.

4208,UghVRY6Tu9P0Z3gCoAEC,kayosiiii,"a few points.
1) Though we see, a few historical examples of women in armour they are few and far between. We don't really have an example culture that both wore heavy armour and routinely fielded women on the battlefield. The closest thing you could possibly argue are mercenary armies in the late middle ages, but even then we have accounts more so than depictions or the armour itself. Certainly blacksmiths weren't building armour specifically for women more than probably once in a blacksmiths lifetime. 
We can say that certain types of armour didn't happen, but we can't say therefore it wouldn't work, the very uncommonness of women in armour explains why the designs didn't deviate significantly from what men wore. 

2) A secondary purpose or amour is signalling, communicating who you are both on and off the battlefield. Depending on the cultural context it might be an advantage or a disadvantage to be identified as a woman. A historical analogy would be  where rich knights would add gilding or other decoration to their armour, This signals to everybody who they are, to enemies that it might be better to ransom them rather than kill them and probably would help gain attention and admiration when not on the battlefield. Obviously there is a balance between decoration and practicality but you can afford to be less practical if the odds of you actually being in a battle despite wearing armour is low.

3) context is important, often some armour is better than no armour. Is the person being depicted a professional soldier, a peasant who thrown together bits that they can find. A vagabond who wears a bit of gear and a weapon chiefly to signal that they are a bit dangerous. Wearing small bits or Armour is a lot less disadvantageous if your opponents are wearing even less armour.

Obviously there are lots of examples that are ridiculous, the classic example being the male character choice being a guy in full plate armour and female character choice getting you what is basically a metal bikini. Radical differences in armour like this should signal a character having significantly different cultural background (and probably not just that way because teenage boy fantasies).",UCERAxVU8gUivy-aDxi33E1w

There's also a small problem (actually a huge one) you're overlooking, the armor being tight in the chest can be the difference between life and death.  If the armor is tight in the chest it's going to restrict breathing which is going to quickly sap your stamina; run out of stamina in the middle of a fight and you're dead.  One reason why women would wear the same armor as men is because there wasn't much demand and there's also the fact that creating space for the breasts is very difficult to do without sacrificing armor integrity when you only have access to medieval European smithing tools and techniques, it would also take more material which would in turn drive up the price.

Additionally, most movies and games take place in fantasy worlds with magic, in such a world there's no saying that the armor isn't enchanted to create some sort of barrier around the wearer or toughen the skin.  The moment you question fantasy is the moment you lose.

Why did knights wear such heavy armor in the first place?  To take hits.  If one is agile enough to avoid hits they don't need any kind of armor, it would actually be detrimental to them to be wearing heavy or inflexible armor.  Guess what? Women are more flexible than men and would be able to pull off this kind of combat style far more effectively than men, even more so if they have less (restrictive) armor.",UC3MBnh1Cpmn5W8WK5SOghow

We know some of the armor's in out history have been pretty pimped out hence I really don't think anyone should call bullshit on armor portraying chest area and muscles on men or women. of course if the movie claims to be 100% accurate to history that is another deal. As for the naked lady armor, I'd say it will look ridiculous if she fights next to fully plate armored men,  though if the environment sells it I'll take it, say for example she is a barbarian, like Arnold in conan, who is super hard core with strange believes and just must fight naked then sure why not, the movie is no longer ridiculous just her character.",UCQWO7CnyNWWXIz2D2jvjKHA

4327,UghSO8fUdTcfJngCoAEC,KuyAurelian,"Not saying that this isn't a ""cultural issue"" that we tend to see women always in sexy garb in games and usually the higher up you go, the skimpier the armor gets, which sort of implies that being sexier is a reward for female characters and thus they should be measured based on their sexiness.

But on the other side of the coin, we also see male armor with (for example) ludicrous shoulder guards and more spikes than a hedgehog. It may not be a similar sort of sexualization as the female one in that the focus is on emphasizing breasts and butts (so far have not seen growing cod pieces as levels go up), but on the other hand as far as I have understood it, most females tend to enjoy a male with the ""Y""-shaped physique and as part of that, shoulder broadness makes for a more appealing aesthetic.

Now, if one were to be fair, we should allow male characters to wear exceedingly skimpy armor. Maybe some guys prefer to flaunt their perfectly toned abs and rounded bubble butts while others just want to re-enact Conan or just their own Berserker fantasy where wearing little more than a piece of leopard pelt is enough.
And allow those who enjoy females in heavy plate to get their enjoyment as well so they can fight side-by-side with their male counterparts and not feel out of place in something that would be more at home on a Victoria's Secret runway.

Clearly more variety is the best option here and both male and female characters should have more options open to them. If one wants to play the ""traditional"" way, then they still can, but others get to enjoy their gaming experience the way they want as well. :)",UCsyZinjgHzrGYQ2RHHZD9rg

Now, that being said, I have one correction: You do not wear mail underneath plate, you wear mail in the gaps of your plate, usually sewn onto your arming jacket, but once you got a plate you simply have no need for the chainmail anymore.
Secondly: Please! Please! Please!

Do something about that chainmail! Okay, its a low quality chainmail, but thats no excuse to wear it that poorly, here is what you need to do:
1: Put a thread of linen, or leather, through the rings around the neck and tighten it, it needs to be sitting around your neck so that your entire shoulders carry the weight, not just the mid-outer part of your shoulders.
2: Put some thread through the sleeves to tighten them up, or better yet, cut out some of the rings and adjust it, a chainmail is supposed to hang slightly loose, but this is way past that point.
3: Tighten that belt around your waist and fold the chainmail over the belt, so that your hips carry a part of the weight.",UCcVVkS5Y3KLCJzL9XKzQ3Dw

 to protect'.  Wrong here.  The bra part is dumb.  But the armored 
shoulders, forearms, and back of hands are HUGELY protective.  Watch 
saber fencers fight and note that most often they attack the 
hand/wrist/forearm to score, or what would be in real war, to dismember 
and disarm, leaving the person open for a killing shot.  Being able to 
parry with or shrug off an attack with an arm or thigh allows you to 
then have an open attack while their weapon is 'pressed' by the armored 
limb. 
Also ever see a female fencer wear a male's chest protector and get hit over a boob?  Yeah they /DO NOT LIKE THAT/...  AT ALL!!!  Having bikini armor is stupid, having a shaped expansion to make room for breasts so that impacts press against the the actual non-breast chest, muscle and bone structure points, is hugely different.   As to men, try wearing a really tight cup in martial arts and take even a fairly light groin impact..  When you get back up later, it will be to go buy one larger.

I´d explain it simply as this:
Since in most human cultures warfare was associated with men´s society, there won´t be much questions on how historic womens armor are. Therefore the equipment for doing so was based on the needs of men and efforts. Women - if they took part in fights - never were part of basic infantry. Even though they hadn´t the right to wear swords or armor, or status symbols associated with men´s society at all. Based on that there were no armors like specific breastplates or whatsoever - it´s all just fantasy. 
Sometimes there are some exceptions if you look at world history such as the Onna Bushi or different indian tribes but since women overall never were preferred to fight wars one could say there are so few armor or arms specialized for women, that it doesn´t really count.",UCqrrt--SCCV3d78UmkKDJcQ

From what I've read, in late-medieval and renaissance Europe gender roles were very strict. Men went into battle, ruled and had professions that men were expected to have in that time. Women had different professions, and were only influential behind the scenes. It was a patriarchal society.  Any exception to this would have caused a huge fuss. This is one of the reasons why joan of arc is so significant.I am however in agreement that for a fantasy setting, armor for women should look no different than it does for men. Also I am fairly certain that those depictions of joan of arc are not from the early 15th century , and I would therefore be cautious to accept them as a credible depiction of her armor.

Seriously dude, if we ever hope to win this fight against feminism and the ""overly offended"", we don't need people pandering to them in hopes that they won't be offended by the fact that you're showing a video that has ""virtual skin"" in it...

-_-

If you want to put a disclaimer before your video, just say ""Hey - There's nudity in this"", as opposed to getting down on all fours and licking the asshole (yeah - I said ""asshole"", and anyone triggered by that word can fuck off) of stupid SJWs/feminists.

It makes me sad everytime I see men submit to this subversive goddamn bullshit, so I really hope you think about what you were ACTUALLY saying, and take a moment to reflect on whether it is men or women who are truly oppressed, assuming you're not going to search for vids on the matter, which is the norm for dudebros, judges (ya' know - The people that hand down life sentences for false rape accusations by crazy bitches just because they have the right genitals), and police officers (they usually don't investigate rape allegations as much as they should, but that's because if you get convicted of rape, they might get a raise/promotion, so why would they!?  Interestingly enough, also, is that men are accused more than women ten-fold (weird, huh?))... (*[OBLIGITORY RAPE PARTY!]*).

Unfortunately, I don't have the right genitals, nor do you. I'm sure some people appreciate your warning, but I imagine 90% of your audience didn't need it ('cuz I fuckin' hope that 90% of your audience isn't SJW's/feminists who'll be offended if you say ""he"" instead of ""him/her"")...

Still, stop pandering to SJWs/feminists. They derive their power from dumb-fucks like you submitting to their ""over-offendedness "".

YOU DO NOT NEED TO SUBMIT TO THIS.

You don't need to submit to feminism either (you see what I did thar?)...

Stop submitting to unreasonable people, please - You don't have disclaimers at the beginning of your video that the video contains white people (for the Black Panthers), or that it contains white people (for the KKK), so shut the fuck up about the ""trigger warnings"" for SJWs/feminists who are part of a group that is very, VERY similar to the Black Panthers/KKK...",UCMyPTJfStLV97Zhh2pgzBWg

4481,UgiQEzmf3CmYNXgCoAEC,k goblin,"Alright, couple of minor nitpicks, I agree with the main point that chain-mail bikinis are both unrealistic & *way* to prevalent in contemporary art... but everytime this topic comes up I see these points get flubbed: 

* Fantasy Art: mostly naked males were not that rare during the 1950-1980s heyday of sword-&-sorcery art; which is where the chainmail-bikini trope being critiqued here comes from. Don't believe me? go do a google images search on Frank Frazetta & Boris Vallejo, and start counting. 
It is also worth noting that Conan's iconic appearance comes from the afore mentioned artists... not the text itself. And Conan was far from being the only male protagonist to experience this treatment.  
Obviously, more contemporary artists are not as even handed handed about it, as Metatron points out... but the original 'chainmail-bikini' art style *was* applied pretty evenly across the sexes.

* Historicity: Let us be blunt here; there are very few historical examples of women in armor. The social & cultural norms did not really allow for women warriors to wear said armor. What few examples there are (best known o/c being Jean of Arc) are exceptions to the rule. This is no different than asking how a 19th century male corset would look... ultimately left mostly to the imagination b/c a 19th century male wearing a corset would be rare & exceptional.

* Plate Armor Fit: Full plate armor was ideally custom fit to the wearer; thus hypothetical full plate for women WOULD have differences from male plate armor, especially around the shoulders, hips & bust areas, where the primary morphological differences b/w men & women are. 
The differences might be visually subtle, but they would be there, and the armorer at least would be very aware of them. 
Note that the first thing out of Aurora's mouth is that the armor is a 'bit tight'. Bit tight is not what you want in custom fitted battle/athletic gear you're going to be wearing all day in a medieval war zone.",UCGYKnyi-IjF7omzRbxAsMGw

4503,Ugjm3dFZPc5DhXgCoAEC,Steve Powell,"For the bulk of history, plate armour wasn't available as smiths couldn't work the metal into strong enough plates to assemble plate armour from. The Roman Lorica Segmentata was around from around 9BC, but it was lighter strips of metal, not proper plate, and it wasn't quite as common as some believe, although it was more common that scale armour. The Romans used maille armour, too, but relied on their shields as their primary defense. 

You're looking at the 14th century for full plate harnesses (what most see as plate armour), and they were phased out by the mid-16th century. Plate segments were used to reinforce maille armour from much earlier (referred to by some as plate maille) but those started as smaller, lighter plate segments to later replace the maille beneath as the smiths were able to work heavier plate sections, and from late 16th, early 17th century, solders had mostly moved back to leather, with perhaps a back-and-breast with tassets to protect the upper legs. Only the helm has really remained plated, mostly because it is the easiest thing to hit if you're fighting someone with a shield. That and it needs smaller bits of plate to make.

Most likely, women would wear maille or leather, or a coat of plates (my favourite!)  rather than a plate harness. It would offer greater flexibility, for one, and greater mobility. It would be rare to armour a woman in plate - which is why it was such a point of significance that Joan of Arc had such a suit. However, various depictions of her do show her in only partial plate, or plate maille rather than a plate harness, so it's not clear what form the plate armour took.",UC4b3N1q50ur4d1mgvv4r34w

I mean, I don't want to defend this ridiculous armor trope but I understand the predicament the artists are in. They need a way to point out that the person in the armor is a woman because in real armor everyone would look the same. This is a problem with the audience mostly.

The difference being some of the lighter ones like fur, which had coverings for the bosoms while shirtless for the men. The heavier armors had some slight variations so you could tell who was what but ultimately all looked the same.

Reminds me, since I'm a new viewer. I should see if you've done a video about the various armors in skyrim. Could be an interesting one to cover if you haven't. (Yes I know skyrim is super old, but it's still popular.)

In that case i could see very very light decorative even fanciful armor making sense. But that is not armor then.. its a costume.

The only place i can think of anything like this historically is Japan ware the 'Samurai' cast who were traditionally warriors at periods in history took on courtly and very non warrior functions. There would be 'Samurai' casts who were never warriors and especially not in there day to day lifes that was much more like a scribe or a high level functionary.

You'll be glad to know, that neither Dragon Age 2 and Inquisition have titted armor that I recall. In fact, The Iron Bull comments to Cassandra about her pragmatic wardrobe, and that it's the noble women who buy titted armor. And while Dragon Age Origins had titted armor, I don't recall the plate armor being titted (though surprisingly spandex on female elves).

Her name is Emmanuel, her armour is unique, it has a fitted look somewhat like 15th century, save that the pattern of it's plating is reminiscent of Roman Legionaries, the plating covers the legs, front shoulders, sides around the neck etc.

However her back is not plated, underneath the plate there is ringed mail layered above linen and some padding around heavy parts of the armour.

She also has a kind of embroiled medium dress that flows from beneath her armour and is layered over a kind of loose leather over skirt armour that connects around the lower waist.

Her sword is a Germanic style Long Sword with a chainsaw blade powered by Mana flowed directly into a Manadrive inside the handle, the Mana used to power the Chainsaw blade is supplied by Emmanuel during combat hence why despite fighting as a knight she would technically be a Battlemage.

Now, the Greeks didn't have heavy armour as we think of it in the plate mail sense, and outside of their functional armour they were not exactly a modest culture in terms of attire. That and the Amazons are not typically shown as some sort of heavily armoured female hoplite either. In terms of the Romans, it's too easy to forget the point where all gladiatorial combatants were armoured in a way that made for the best entertainment in blood sport, rather than the most practical armour for the battlefield.",UCQJPApPi0WEa9OyCIbB3uig

though at the same time, I've got other characters that wear actual full plate armor.
in the MMORPG I mostly play, Guild Wars 2, a couple of nice examples are:
the human light and medium cultural tier 3 armors, they won't be functional... armor like the vigil armor is slightly more functional, though looking at something like the human cultural tier 3 heavy armor looks pretty functional for heavy armor (although all the female armors do still show some womanly features)",UC2EnsV3zPp3Ww7hEKw1vlAw

Hence, a chainmail bikini. For full armor, I think your´e right there would be little difference. Unless your armourer would be like the ancient greeks and create muscleshaped plates. Heroic nudity thing, which you mention in the video. But most people in medieval battles did not wear much armor but for a helmet and a shield, because of the price. The shield would protect you from arrows, and from short distance you need worry more about spears, axes and swordcuts.

I love video game armor when all the main arteries/veins, ligaments & other vital areas are totally exposed. Even with men's armor, showing off their abs or thighs. Makes me feel more epic when I'm stabbing my enemies. Any ab grooves or 'belly buttons' are basically guidelines for getting caught in or weakens metal anyways.

You're right that the cups don't make sense. A breast plate should be as flat & smooth as possible so nothing can catch. Even if a slashing weapon doesn't penetrate, the bludgeoning/force against a cup could send the attacked stumbling.

Breast wise i am not sure if you would actually have to fix something cause the average woman doesnt have a bigger chest (i am talking about in total not jut the boobs) than a man. Ofc if the woman has huge breasts youd need to adjust that but i think the average woman would be ok with an armor made for a mans chest or even needing it a bit smaller.

Some tried it - and bought breastplates made ""for women"", and even when wearing a gambeson, they ended up with their breasts hurt really badly. Moreover, movements were not as comfortable as in the standard armour. And of course, as you have said, the shape drives swords to punch places in the bosom.

Yes, first half of XV is not a really full plate armour, but the issues are quite the same. In fact, I prefer full cuirass than a coat of plates... 

What is interesting, some of them were, hm, quite busty women too. How did they solve their problem? Training bra! And as they have told me - they wear training bras because they have them (fitness etc.) and they are better for their breasts. But they tried also using bandages and those worked very well too, only were problematic to put every time they went training - that's why they wear training bras.

So, some women in reenactment in Poland tried it on their own bodies and the answer is simple. The full plate armour is as good as it can be for both men and women.",UCiX1C_eRuzT2Y1Q9Nyf0U4g

From what I have seen the same kind of people who would complain about those kind of pictures, would also complain about being asked not to view it if they don't like it. I think the subject well though. It can be one of those touchy topics. And so while I don't think a disclaimer accomplishes much I can understand the want to have one.

Regarding women's armor in video games. We can probably say that the majority of it is unrealistic. But I think giving repair to that is a bit harder then basically saying Women's armor would realistically looks pretty much like men's armor. Because there simply isn't a great tradition in most cultures throughout most of history of women wearing armor. The few instances we have of women in armor...It is pretty much a man's armor sized to them. That works for a one off case (as well as it can work). 

But let's pretend that Joan of Arch inspired a lot of other women to do the same. And France in this alternate timeline developed a tradition of having female warriors. Over time these women warriors would probably end up making changes that work better with their anatomy. I think given a few 100 years of this, a man and a woman's armor might look similar, but would probably also have some significant differences in the details. I mean women are in aggregate shorter and less heavily built then men, but also more flexible with a lower center of balance. A bit more articulation here a bit less there, a few profile changes, probably a little lighter overall....armor developed for women (and not just a man's armor sized to fit a woman). I'd like to see ideas of what that would end up looking like.",UCV7_l_xcND-XJNlBINrn7Og

She made no real contributions, partook in no battles, and lead no one - she was essentially a motivational speaker wearing armor and holding a sword that she didn't know how to use. She is the epitome of ""all talk no walk."" So for that I have to hate her and am annoyed by her myth and legendary status. 

A woman who ACTUALLY did something is Harriot Tubman - SHE is rightfully lionized as she actually put herself in harms way to help others and ACTUALLY led commando type units into the south and fought in combat, often times leading men through the thick of battle.

I don't understand the obsession with showing flesh all the time - it seems to me to be aimed at slightly immature people who haven't got over the novelty of seeing some skin (although i may be wrong). Is it not more attractive to see a strong woman in full armour, armed and ready for battle and able to defend herself? Really attractiveness shouldn't be the primary consideration in a film or game anyway, but - of course - its nice to see in both genders. I wish the people who make these games/films would just try to make things a bit more realistic.",UCE3IkcHuypyFhpOZqeQES6w
